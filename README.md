# Random City Generator
This program generates a random map of a city with roads, intersections, and lakes. As the roads are built, cars start to spawn and drive around. The user can move around the city using the arrow keys. If the user clicks on an intersection, the cars will all try to drive to it. Cars will despawn if they crash into each other, or get stuck at a dead end for too long.
